He led the development of Analytics, our internal BI platform, which has become a strategic tool across the organization. The system provides real-time visibility into our operations and performance, supporting operational and technical decision-making at all levels. What impressed us most was Rogerio's ability to combine deep technical expertise with a clear understanding of our business challenges. The platform is intuitive, fast, and scalable — and continues to evolve based on our teams' needs. Today, Analytics isn't just a dashboard — it's an essential part of how we operate. I recommend Rogerio for any organization looking to transform data into action and strategy.",

One of the most impactful changes was in managing our medication cabinets — which now remain securely locked and accessible only to authorized staff. It also simplified and secured visitor access, giving families controlled entry while keeping our residents safe. The platform is reliable, easy to use, and has become an essential part of how we manage our facility. I'm very satisfied with the results.",
